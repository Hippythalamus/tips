# tips
A structured collection of small technical experiments, notes, and practice projects. This repository is not meant to be production-ready code — it serves mainly as a personal knowledge base and a practical sandbox to refresh concepts I tend to forget.


**Contents include:**

 - Modern C++17 techniques and patterns

 - ROS2 robot development (URDF, controllers, hardware interfaces)

 - Practical interview-style exercises

 - Algorithms, iterators, and memory-model explorations

 - Low-level systems programming samples

The goal is to maintain a clean, growing collection of examples I can quickly reference during interviews or reuse as a foundation for future robotics work.
